	<!--- The Preparation of the recipe in an ordered list -->
 <h3> Instructions </h3>
		<ol class="List2">
			<li> Pour the chicken stock and the tomato stew into a sizeable pot and leave to boil.</li>
			<li> Add the drained parboiled rice, curry powder, salt and pepper to taste. The water level should be the same level of the rice. This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked. </li>
			<li> Cover the pot and leave to cook on low to medium heat. This way the rice doesn't burn before the water dries up. </li>
			<li> After that, taste to confirm. If not, you will need to add more water and reduce the heat to prevent burning.</li>
			<li> Keep cooking till done.</li>

 <h2>The Second Recipe</h2>
	<h3> Ingredients </h3>
	 <ul class="List1">
	 <li>4 Tablespoons of Canola oil</li>
		<li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
		<li>4 Fresh tomatoes or one 14.5oz can of diced (no salt) Hunts tomato (I seriously suggest using this brand If you decide to buy canned)</li>
		<li>1 6oz can Tomato paste</li>
		<li>4 Red onions</li>
		<li>2 Red bell peppers (tatashe)</li>
		<li>4 Habanero pepper (scotch bonnet) (put as much or as little as you want, depending on how spicy you want your rice)</li>
		<li>4 1/2 cups of long-grain parboiled rice</li>
		<li>2 cups of chicken stock</li>
	</ul>
	
 <!-- The instructions in an ordered list-->
 <h3>Instructions</h3>
 <ol class="List2">
 <li> Heat about 4 tablespoons of canola oil and butter in a medium-sized pot on medium heat and throw in some chopped red onions. Allow the onions to fry until the redness starts to slightly fade off.</li>
 <li>Next, pour in your tomato paste and let it fry with the onions. Make sure to stir the paste consistently to avoid burning. Do this for about 10 mins, or until the paste fully fries in the oil. Add in your crayfish for an extra tasty flavor.</li>
 <li>Blend some tomatoes, onions, habanero peppers, and red bell peppers together until you achieve a smooth consistency.</li>
 <li>Pour in the blended mixture into the pot and fry it together with the tomato paste.</li>
 <li>Add all your spices (BUT DON’T ADD SALT YET) and mix. Cover the pot and allow the tomato to fry in the oil. Add more oil if necessary. You really want to let the tomato fry to remove the slappy sour taste, so make sure you don’t rush this process. I would recommend letting it fry for about 20-30 mins. Be sure to continuously stir the mixture to avoid burning.</li>
 <li>At this point, while the tomato is frying, begin to wash your long grain parboiled rice. Make sure to get rid of as much starch as possible by washing the rice until the water used becomes very clear. This helps to avoid the rice from sticking together when cooking.</li>
 <li>Once the tomato is done frying, add your chicken stock to the mix and taste to see if it requires any salt. Add salt if necessary and mix.</li>
 <li>Now add in your washed rice (and a bit of water if necessary to cook the rice) and mix it together with the fried tomatoes. Turn down the heat to the lowest on your burner and cover the pot. I personally like to cover the pot with aluminum foil before putting on the lid just to make sure the heat stays within the pot without escaping from the lid hole.</li>
 <li>Allow the rice to cook for about 30 minutes.</li>
 <li>After about 30 minutes open the pot and properly combine all the ingredients together. Cover the pot again, and let it cook for an additional 10 minutes or until the rice has fully blended in with the mixture.</li>

 <h2>The Third Recipe</h2>
 <h3> Ingredients</h3>
 <ul class="List1">
 <li>4 cups uncooked long-grain rice (not basmati)</li>
	<li>5 - 6 cups stock (vegetable, chicken, or beef) or water, divided</li>
	<li>6 medium-sized fresh plum/Roma tomatoes, chopped, OR a 400-gram tin of tomatoes.</li>
	<li>6 fresh, red poblano peppers (or 4 large red bell peppers), seeds discarded</li>
	<li>3 medium-sized red onions (1 sliced thinly, 2 roughly chopped), divided</li>
	<li>1 Scotch bonnet peppers (yellow is my favorite!), to taste.</li>
	<li>1/3 cup oil (vegetable/ canola/coconut, not olive oil)</li>
	<li>3 tablespoons tomato paste.</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons (Carribean/Jamaican-style) curry powder.</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon (heaping) dried thyme.</li>
	<li>2 dried bay leaves </li>
	<li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter (optional), divided.</li>
	<li>1 dash Salt, to taste.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- The instructions in an ordered list -->
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol class="List2">
	<li>	Rinse the rice to get rid of some starch then parboil: Bring the rice to a boil with 2 cups of the stock (or water) then cook on medium heat, covered, about 12 to 15 minutes. Rice will still be hard, a bit "white" (not translucent) and only partly cooked. Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
	<li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, red poblano (or bell) peppers, chopped onions, and scotch bonnet; blend till smooth, about a minute or two. You should have roughly 4 cups of blended mix.</li>
	<li>In a large pan, heat oil and add sliced onion. Season with a pinch of salt, stir-fry for a minute or two, then add the tomato paste, curry powder, dried thyme and bay leaves. Stir for another 2 minutes. Add the blended tomato-pepper-scotch bonnet mixture, stir, and set on medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes so the mix cooks and the raw taste of the tomatoes is gone. You might feel your eyes sting with onions.</li>
	<li>Don't be afraid to add some more stock or water—by the half-cup, stirring gently—if you find it a bit hard. When it’s cooked, take off heat and remove the cover of the pot. Put a tea cloth over the top and leave for half an hour or more, till ready to serve.</li>
	<li>To make Party Rice, you'll need one more step. Now Party Rice is essentially Smoky Jollof Rice, traditionally cooked over an open fire. However, you can achieve the same results on the stove top. Here's how: Once the rice is cooked, turn up the heat with the lid on and leave to "burn" for 3 to 5 minutes. You'll hear the rice crackled and snap and it will smell toasted. Turn off the heat and leave with the lid on to "rest" till ready to serve. The longer the lid stays on, the smokier. Let the party begin!</li>

	<li>	1 medium sized onion, roughly chopped, set aside.</li>
	<li>2 scotch bonnet peppers (habanero peppers as they are sometimes called)</li>
	<li>¼ cup of groundnut oil.</li>
	<li>3 tbsp tomato paste.</li>
	<li>2 cups of parboiled rice</li>
	<li>2½ cups of chicken stock</li>
	<li>1 tsp salt to taste</li>

	</ul>		
	
	<!-- The instructions in an ordered list -->
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol class="List2">
	<li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.</li>
	<li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about ¼ cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li>
	<li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add the parboiled rice** to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</li>
	<li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew**, cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li>

	<li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter (optional), divided.</li>
	<li>Salt,to taste</li>

	<!-- The instructions in an ordered list -->
	<h3>Instructions</h3>

	<li>Add 2 cups of the stock to the cooked tomato sauce, 1 teaspoon of butter, and then add the rice. Stir, cover with a double piece of foil/ baking or parchment paper and put a lid on the pan. This will seal in the steam and lock in the flavour. Cook on low heat for 15 minutes. Stir again, adjust seasoning to taste, then add the remaining 1 cup of stock. Stir gently, cover with foil/ baking or parchment paper and let cook for another 15 to 20 minutes, stirring gently to prevent burning, till the rice is cooked and the grains are separate.</li>
	<li>Don’t be afraid to add some more stock or water—by the half-cup, stirring gently—if you still find the rice needs it. When it’s cooked, take off heat and remove the cover of the pot. Put a tea cloth over the top and leave for half an hour or more, till ready to serve.</li>
